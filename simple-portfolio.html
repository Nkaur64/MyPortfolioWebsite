    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a beginner web designer eager to learn and grow in the tech industry. With over 4 years of experience delivering exceptional customer service in retail and food hospitality, I’ve recently shifted my focus to web design and development.<br>I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, and this is one of my first basic web pages. I've been hands-on building my skills and developing a passion for creating responsive, user-friendly websites that look great on any device.<br>I thrive in fast-paced environments, love solving problems, and always meet deadlines. I'm also a strong communicator who enjoys collaborating with both technical and non-technical teams.</p>
    
    <p>This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far—thanks for checking it out!</p>
